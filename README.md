## Introduction

The Dokkan Battle EZA Farming Bot is a Python script designed to automate the process of farming the Extreme Z-Awakening levels in Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle. The script runs on your computer and interacts with the game on your phone.

_This bot is no a autoclicker_; it not only completes the levels but also manages the current level of the EZA and switches between different EZAs.
